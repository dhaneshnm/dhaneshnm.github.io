Hello There,

I am Dhanesh Neela Mana. I have been working on web technologies as an Engineer, Tech Lead and Engineering Manager for the last 14 years.

In the past I have worked with various Backend and Front End technologies such as C#/.Net, Java/Spring, Ruby/Rails, Jquery etc. I have also written quite a bit of SQL for postgres and sql server. For the past few years, I have been focusing on React and Typescript. I am passionate about building performant and scalable web applications, with a focus on intuitive and easy to use UI.

I am originally from India. From 2011, I studied, worked and lived in US East coast for about eight years. I spent next five years in Lausanne, Switzerland (2019-2024). Since 2024, I live in College Station, Texas.
