Hi there,

I am Dhanesh Neela Mana. I have been working on web technologies as an Engineer, Tech Lead and Engineering Manager.

In past I have worked with various Backend and Front End technologies such as C#/.Net, Java/Spring, Ruby/Rails, Jquery etc. I have also written quite a bit of SQL for postgres and sqlserver.

For past few years, I have been focusing on React and Typescript.
I am passionate about building perfomant and sacalable web applications, with a focus on intuitive and easy to use UI.
Currently, I am a Tech Lead at [Ta media](https://www.tamedia.ch/fr/page-daccueil).
