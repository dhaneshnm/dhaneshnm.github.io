Hello There,

I am Dhanesh Neela Mana. I have been working on web technologies as an Engineer, Tech Lead and Engineering Manager for the last 14 years.

In the past I have worked with various Backend and Front End technologies such as C#/.Net, Java/Spring, Ruby/Rails, Jquery etc. I have also written quite a bit of SQL for postgres and sql server.

For the past few years, I have been focusing on React and Typescript.
I am passionate about building performant and scalable web applications, with a focus on intuitive and easy to use UI. Currently, I am a Tech Lead Manager at [Ta media](https://www.tamedia.ch/fr/page-daccueil).

I am originally from India. I studied, worked and lived in US East coast for about a decade. Currently, I live and work in Lausanne, Switzerland.
