I recently finished reading Tiago Forte's , <a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/book" target="_blank">Builing a second brain</a>. I have been a digital note taker for many years. I started with microsoft onenote, then moved to evernote and now use notion to keep all my digital notes. The book takes the idea of digital note taking to anothe level. A well structured, easily findable digital note collection is what Tiago brands as a "second brain".

The key take a away for me is to better organise my digital notes for "discoverbility" and frequently (weekely/monthly) review and re-orgainise the notes.

It was a very interesting read and I leave you with a mind map summary of the book.
