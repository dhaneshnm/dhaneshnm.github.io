In Extreme Programming, two engineers work together: one writes the test while the other writes code to pass that test.
Now imagine replacing the code-writing engineer with an AI agent, while the human engineer writes tests in plain English.
I believe this is how software will be created in the near future. I wonder if I can start creating software this way today. For the next week, I'll try this approach: I'll write the tests first, and let Copilot write the code.
